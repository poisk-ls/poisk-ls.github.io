# Hello there! ^_^

##  I'm Jade Nelson N. Buhayan

- I’m someone who values consistency, growth, and staying grounded in every step I take. I’ve always believed that showing up with purpose matters more than making noise. I stay calm under pressure, listen more than I speak, and work best when I’m focused on a goal with a clear path forward.

- I have a natural curiosity for technology and a deep respect for process, precision, and learning. Whether it's diving into software systems, supporting a team, or simply figuring out the most efficient way to solve a problem—I do it with patience and care.

- My strength lies in reliability. I value trust, both giving and earning it, and I take pride in being someone people can count on. Every task I take on, I handle with attention to detail and a commitment to doing it right.

- I’m here not just to work—I’m here to grow, contribute, and move forward with integrity.


Here's the list of my site!🫰🏿
